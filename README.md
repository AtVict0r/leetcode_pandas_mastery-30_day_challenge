# 30 Days of Pandas Challenge

Welcome to my 30 Days of Pandas Challenge repository! üêº

## Introduction

Over the course of 30 days, I embarked on a journey to dive deep into Pandas, a powerful library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. Throughout this challenge, I encountered a variety of problems and solutions, honing my skills in filtering, string methods, data manipulation, statistics, data aggregation, and data integration.

## My Journey

### Week 1: Data Filtering
I started my journey by tackling fundamental concepts like filtering data. From identifying big countries to classifying recyclable and low-fat products, these challenges taught me the importance of selecting and extracting meaningful information from large datasets.

### Week 2: String Methods
In the second week, I delved into string methods to clean and process textual data. I encountered tasks like fixing names in a table and calculating special bonuses. Learning these techniques proved crucial for preparing data for further analysis.

### Week 3: Data Manipulation
Data manipulation skills were put to the test in the third week. I explored techniques to find the Nth highest salary and delete duplicate emails. These challenges helped me grasp the art of reshaping data and handling duplicates effectively.

### Week 4: Statistics
As I progressed, I delved into statistical analysis. Tasks like calculating the number of rich customers and categorizing salary data added depth to my understanding of data summarization and analysis.

### Week 5: Data Aggregation
Data aggregation became the focus of the fifth week. I learned to analyze employee time spent and group sold products by date. These challenges illuminated the significance of summarizing data for insights.

### Week 6: Data Integration
In the final week, I explored data integration tasks. I dived into merging and joining datasets, discovering how actors and directors collaborate, replacing employee IDs, and finding unique subjects taught by each teacher.

## Challenges and Growth

Throughout this journey, I encountered a range of challenges that pushed me to think critically and creatively. The process of dissecting and solving each problem nurtured my problem-solving skills and expanded my data manipulation toolkit.

## Conclusion

The 30 Days of Pandas Challenge has been an enlightening experience. As I wrap up this journey, I am equipped with a solid foundation in Pandas and data manipulation. I look forward to applying these newfound skills to real-world projects and exploring more advanced concepts in the world of data science and analysis.
